# 🦠 COVID-19 Insights Dashboard – Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that provides a comprehensive analysis of **global COVID-19 pandemic data**.  
It transforms complex, multi-country datasets into **clear visual analytics** that highlight key metrics, trends, and geographic patterns of the pandemic.

The dashboard is designed to help **policy makers, healthcare organizations, researchers, and the public** make informed decisions by visualizing critical information such as **total cases, fatalities, case fatality rates (CFR), and global spread** in an interactive manner.

The solution is organized into **two main sections**:
1. **Overview Dashboard** – KPIs, trends, and top country comparisons.
2. **Map View** – Geographic spread and severity visualization.

## 🚨 Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented global health, social, and economic impacts.  
Governments, healthcare providers, and the public rely heavily on **timely, accurate, and visualized data** to understand the scale of infections, mortality rates, and speed of spread.

However, several challenges hinder effective decision-making:
- **Data Complexity:** Large volumes of raw COVID-19 data are difficult to interpret quickly.
- **Hotspot Identification:** Hard to pinpoint countries and regions with the highest case burdens and fatalities.
- **Risk Monitoring:** Comparing **Case Fatality Rates (CFR)** across locations is cumbersome.
- **Impact Proportionality:** Understanding the relationship between infections and deaths without visualization is difficult.
- **Geographic Awareness:** Lack of clear spatial representation for outbreak severity.

This dashboard addresses these issues by combining **KPI-driven analytics** and **interactive geographic visualizations**.
